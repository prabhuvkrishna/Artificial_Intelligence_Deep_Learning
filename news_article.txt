5 years after its Pluto flyby, New Horizons spacecraft forges ahead

When NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto five years ago this
week, it captured detailed views of the mysterious icy dwarf planet on
the edge of our solar system.

Since then, data gathered about Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, have
been used to gain insight about these planetary bodies 4 billion miles
away from Earth.

New Horizons launched in January 2006 and reached Pluto in July 2015,
flying within 7,800 miles of Pluto’s surface.

The stunning images shared by New Horizons showed both Earth-like
characteristics on the surface as well as alien landscapes and geology
not seen anywhere else in our solar system.

Rather than being a quiet, frozen dwarf planet, data revealed that Pluto
is actually very active.

Pluto is smaller than Earth’s moon and only about 1,400 miles wide.
Charon, Pluto’s largest moon, is so similar in size that the two orbit
each other like a double planet system.

If you stood on Pluto’s surface, where the average temperature is
negative 387 degrees Fahrenheit, you would see blue skies, red snow, and
mountains towering like the Rockies.

New Horizons also revealed the strange mechanics of Pluto’s heart-shaped
glacier, known as Tombaugh Regio, named after Clyde Tombaugh who
discovered Pluto in 1930.

Much of Pluto’s nitrogen ice is concentrated in a deep basin called
Sputnik Planitia. During the day, frozen nitrogen warms into vapor. At
night, it condenses back into ice — creating what scientists call
Pluto’s “heartbeat,” which drives atmospheric circulation.

Some scientists believe a liquid ocean may exist beneath Pluto’s ice
shell.

The spacecraft also revealed cratered surfaces, methane-ice dunes shaped
by wind, and geological features that suggest Pluto’s surface is far
younger than the dwarf planet itself.

In January 2019, New Horizons flew past another Kuiper Belt Object
called Arrokoth, giving scientists new insight into the formation of our
solar system.

New Horizons continues its journey through the outer solar system,
sending back data from billions of miles away.
